## Executive Summary

This project delivers a comprehensive **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** to audit content performance across 150+ high-growth Instagram Reels in the 2026 landscape.

By leveraging **Python-based scraping** and **SQL-driven business intelligence**, the analysis:

* Identifies the **“Golden Hours”** for engagement
* Quantifies the **ROI of sponsored content vs. organic creator averages**
* Detects viral outliers using performance indexing

---

#  Key Project Features

### Automated Data Extraction

Engineered a custom Python scraper to pull engagement metrics while maintaining 2026 security compliance.

### Privacy-First Architecture

Implemented a data anonymization script to protect creator identities using unique `User_ID` mapping.

### Advanced SQL Analysis

Built a relational database (SQLite) to calculate complex metrics like:

* **Performance Index**
* **Relative ROI**
* Viral Outlier Detection

### Console-Based Visualization

Developed custom SQL functions to generate “Sparkline” bar charts directly in the terminal for rapid insight verification.

# 1. Core Findings & Insights

##  Peak Engagement Windows (IST)

The analysis identified two distinct traffic surges:

* **00:00 IST (Midnight)** → High individual virality
* **18:00 – 20:00 IST** → Most reliable window for consistent reach

Conclusion:
While midnight can produce viral spikes, **evening hours (18:00–20:00 IST)** are optimal for predictable performance.

---

## 2. Sponsored Content Audit (ROI)

The study revealed an **“Ad-Aura Effect”** in certain creators (e.g., `User_ID_2`), where sponsored content outperformed organic averages by:

> **+145% ROI**

However, some accounts showed **negative ROI**, indicating audience resistance to overt promotional content.

# 🗄️ Technical SQL Implementation

The backbone of this project is a series of optimized SQL queries designed to extract high-level business intelligence from raw engagement data.

---

## Database Schema

The `video_trends` table includes:

### Temporal Tracking

* `Time` (IST)
* `Date`

### Engagement Metrics

* `Views`
* `Likes`
* `Comments`

### Content Metadata

* `Account`
* `Caption`
* `Hashtags`

---

# Advanced Query Highlights

---

## 1. Relational ROI Modeling (Joins & Arithmetic)

Instead of simple averages, this query joins the main table with an aggregated sub-dataset to calculate the **Relative ROI** of sponsored content against each creator’s organic baseline.

```sql
SELECT v.Account, 
       ROUND(((v.Views - avg_table.Avg_Views) * 100.0 / avg_table.Avg_Views), 1) AS ROI_Percent
FROM video_trends v
JOIN (
    SELECT Account, AVG(Views) AS Avg_Views 
    FROM video_trends 
    GROUP BY Account
) avg_table 
ON v.Account = avg_table.Account
WHERE v.Caption LIKE '%#ad%';
```

---

## 2. Performance Indexing (Subqueries)

This window-style subquery creates a performance multiplier for every post to identify viral outliers.

```sql
SELECT Account, Date, Views,
       ROUND((Views * 100.0 / 
              (SELECT AVG(Views) 
               FROM video_trends 
               WHERE Account = v.Account)), 1) AS Perf_Index
FROM video_trends v
WHERE Perf_Index > 200;
```

---

## 3. Temporal Data Transformation (`strftime`)

SQLite's date-time functions were used to:

* Normalize international timestamps
* Convert data into **India Standard Time (IST)**
* Isolate the Golden Hour window (19:00–21:00 IST)

---

#  Key Technical Skills Demonstrated

* **Complex Aggregations:** Advanced `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
* **Data Cleaning:** Filtering noise using `WHERE Views > 0`
* **String Filtering:** Identifying sponsored posts via pattern matching
* **Performance Modeling:** Relative baseline comparisons
* **Console Visualization:** Using `PRINTF` and `substr` to generate SQL-based bar charts
