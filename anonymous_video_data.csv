I switched to Mamamaic after my derm told me 90% of sunscreens don’t actually protect against the aging rays that matter 😳 This one has me COVERED—no white cast, doesn’t pill under makeup, and my skin literally glows like I’ve been on a beach vacay (but protected lol). The texture? Chef’s kiss—melts in like a serum, zero greasiness.
Real talk: I’ve tested 47 sunscreens this year (yes I counted) and this is the ONLY one I’ve repurchased 3 times. My mom, my sister, and my best friend are all obsessed now too 💛
Why it’s different:
🌟 Broad spectrum SPF that actually works on melanin-rich skin
🌟 Doubles as a primer (saves me ₹₹₹)
🌟 Reef-safe because we care about our oceans
🌟 No fragrance = no irritation for my sensitive skin girlies
Comment “LINK” and I’ll DM you the exact shade I use + where to get BOGO offers (seriously this discount  is 🔥)

___
What if the internet didn't free women, but simply taught us new ways to police ourselves? 

In this episode, Ria Chopra (@riachops) speaks about how societal conditioning doesn't stop offline. Online too, women are taught to self-censor, self-blame, and pre-empt judgement—often before anyone else does. From how we post to how we speak, visibility comes with rules we’re expected to enforce on ourselves.

We interviewed Jaivir, a 22-year-old man who discovered he could fly after briefly believing in himself too much.

“I need water” he says: 11 days into being suspended above Carter Road, Mumbai.

What began as a quiet personal breakthrough quickly became India, and the world’s, first superhero moment. Aziz Ansari and Dev Patel are reportedly in early conversations to “bring brown representation” to global media once and for all. 

Akshay Kumar has expressed interest in “bringing dignity to the role.”

Experts say Jaivir represents a growing archetype: the young man who unlocks unlimited potential before unlocking basic foresight. 

“He got the take-off right,” our reporter confirms. “Unfortunately, he did not think about the landing.”

While US debates funding airborne ICE officials, locals remain largely unaffected.
“Huh?” one bystander said.

If you spot a small dot hovering over Mumbai, please send us a photo. The world is watching.
He is still up there.
